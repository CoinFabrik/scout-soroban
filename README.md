Scout is an extensible open-source tool intended to assist Soroban Stellar smart contract developers and auditors detect common security issues and deviations from best practices.

This tool helps developers write secure and more robust smart contracts.

Our interest in this project comes from our experience in manual auditing and vulnerability detection in other blockchains (see [Scout for ink!](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout)).

## Quick Start

**Install Scout Audit:**

Make sure that [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) is installed on your computer. Then, install Scout with the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-scout-audit
```

**Run Scout Audit:**

To run Scout on your project execute the following command:

```bash
cargo scout-audit
```

:bulb: Scout supports [Cargo Workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html). When run on a workspace, Scout will be executed on all packages specified as members of the workspace.

:warning: Make sure that your smart contracts compile properly. Scout won't run if any compilation errors exist.

For more information on installation and usage, please refer to the [Getting Started](https://coinfabrik.github.io/scout-soroban/docs/intro) section in our documentation section below.

## Detectors

Currently Scout includes the following detectors.

## Output formats

You can choose the output format that best suit your needs. Scout offers html, markdown, json, pdf and sarif reports. To specify the desired output run the following command:

```
cargo scout-audit --output-format [html|md|pdf|json|sarif]
```

**HTML report**

## Scout VS Code extension

Add Scout to your development workspace with Scout's VS Code extension to run Scout automatically upon saving your file.

![Scout VS Code extension.](/assets/vscode-extension.png)

:bulb: Tip: To see the errors highlighted in your code, we recommend installing the [Error Lens Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens).

:point_right: Download Scout VS Code from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoinFabrik.scout-audit).

## Scout GitHub Action

Integrate Scout into your CI/CD pipeline! Automatically run the tool against the targeted smart contracts. This immediate feedback loop allows developers to quickly address any issues before merging the code into the main branch, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or vulnerabilities.

## Tests

To validate our tool, we provide a set of code examples located in the [test-cases](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/tree/main/test-cases) folder.

In order to run the integration tests, navigate to `apps/cargo-scout-audit` and run:

```console
cargo test --all --all-features
```

In order to run the tests for a particular test-case, run the same command on that particular test-case folder (e.g: `test-cases/divide-before-multiply/divide-before-multiply-1`)
