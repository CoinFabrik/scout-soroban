Scout is an extensible open-source tool intended to assist Soroban Stellar smart contract developers and auditors detect common security issues and deviations from best practices.

This tool will help developers write secure and more robust smart contracts.

Our interest in this project comes from our experience in manual auditing and our usage of comparable tools in other blockchains.

Following our work with Scout on Polkadot (see [Scout for ink!](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout)), we are planning to develop a CLI and a VS Code plugin that can identify issues in Soroban smart contracts. This tool will include detectors for a prioritized list of vulnerabilities, with the detectors implemented as linters in the Dylint linter.

## Quick Start

For a quick start, make sure that [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) is installed on your computer. Then, install Scout dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link
```

Afterwards, install Scout with the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-scout-audit
```

To run Scout on your project, navigate to its root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cargo scout-audit
```

## Tests

To validate our tool, we provide a set of code examples located in the [test-cases](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/tree/main/test-cases) folder.

In order to run the integration tests, navigate to `apps/cargo-scout-audit` and run:

```console
cargo test --all --all-features
```

In order to run the tests for a particular test-case, run the same command on that particular test-case folder (e.g: `test-cases/divide-before-multiply/divide-before-multiply-1`)
