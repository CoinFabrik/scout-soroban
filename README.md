Scout is an extensible open-source tool intended to assist Soroban Stellar smart contract developers and auditors detect common security issues and deviations from best practices.

This tool helps developers write secure and more robust smart contracts.

Our interest in this project comes from our experience in manual auditing and vulnerability detection in other blockchains (see [Scout for ink!](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout)).

## Quick Start

For a quick start, make sure that [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) is installed on your computer. Then, install Scout dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link
```

Afterwards, install Scout with the following command:

```bash
cargo install --path apps/cargo-scout-audit
```

### CLI

To run Scout on your project, navigate to its root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cargo scout-audit-soroban
```

### VSCode Extension

We built the Scout VSCode Extension to help developers write secure and more robust smart contracts. Listing security issues, and highlighting issues with squiggles and hover-over descriptions, we hope our extension will help you catch vulnerabilities during development.

Install Scout from the Marketplace within the Extensions tab of Visual Studio Code. You can find the extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoinFabrik.scout-audit).

## Tests

To validate our tool, we provide a set of code examples located in the [test-cases](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban/tree/main/test-cases) folder.

In order to run the integration tests, navigate to `apps/cargo-scout-audit` and run:

```console
cargo test --all --all-features
```

In order to run the tests for a particular test-case, run the same command on that particular test-case folder (e.g: `test-cases/divide-before-multiply/divide-before-multiply-1`)
